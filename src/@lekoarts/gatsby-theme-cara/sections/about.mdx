## About

Hello! My name is Gurkirat Saini. I enjoy creating innovative web designs for every type of user. My interest in web development started when I was 8 years old. I saw a 
family-friend create an amazing website using just the notepad on his computer. It was magic watching his ideas come to life and ever since then Iâ€™ve been hooked. <br />
Presently, I have had the privilege of building and maintaining a vast variety of Enterprise Management solutions.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with lately:<br />
<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>    <li>React</li>
<li>Node.js</li>         <li>Firebase</li>
<li>Stripe</li>          <li>GraphQL</li>
<li>AWS</li>            <li>Azure</li>
</ul>
